  *** CIRCOS ERROR ***

      cwd: /home/taliadoros/software/circos-0.69-9/bin

      command: ../bin/circos -conf etc/circos.conf -debug_group summary,timer

  CONFIGURATION FILE ERROR

  Circos could not find the configuration file [etc/circos.conf]. To run Circos,
  you need to specify this file using the -conf flag. The configuration file
  contains all the parameters that define the image, including input files,
  image size, formatting, etc.

  If you do not use the -conf flag, Circos will attempt to look for a file
  circos.conf in several reasonable places such as . etc/ ../etc

  To see where Circos looks for the file, use

      circos -debug_flag io

  To see how configuration files work, create the example image, whose
  configuration and data are found in example/. From the Circos distribution
  directory,

      cd example

      ../bin/circos -conf ./circos.conf

  or use the 'run' script (UNIX only).

  Configuration files are described here

      http://circos.ca/tutorials/lessons/configuration/configuration_files/

  and the use of command-line flags, such as -conf, is described here

  This error can also be produced if supporting configuration files, such as
  track defaults, cannot be read.
